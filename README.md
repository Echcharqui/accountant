# accountant
This project involves the development of a REST API-based accounting application designed to automate and manage monthly financial tasks. It starts by assessing the user's bank balances and cash on hand. The application categorizes expenses based on predefined priorities, with each category featuring its own set of needs, priorities, and funding requirements. It calculates the funds needed for each category, beginning with the highest priority, and then performs money transfers from the bank to designated deposits. Post-initial setup, an automated task (cron job) repeats the process every 31 days, ensuring consistent financial management and resource allocation.
